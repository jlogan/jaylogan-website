              With over <span className="text-accent font-semibold">25 years of experience</span> in
              web technology, I've built my career on turning complex problems into elegant digital solutions. 
              From the early days of web development to today's cutting-edge frameworks, I've continuously 
              evolved my skills to stay at the forefront of technology.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              My journey has taken me through <span className="text-primary font-semibold">agencies,
              startups, and independent projects</span>, where I've worn many hats—developer, architect, 
              project manager, and technical leader. This diverse experience gives me a unique perspective 
              on building products that not only work technically but also succeed in the real world.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I'm passionate about <span className="text-accent font-semibold">bridging the gap between 
              technical complexity and user needs</span>. Whether it's a custom WordPress solution, 
              a modern React application, or a full-stack platform, I focus on delivering solutions that 
              are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with business goals.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Beyond the code, I'm someone who values clear communication, collaborative problem-solving, 
              and building products that people actually want to use. I'm always exploring new technologies 
              and approaches—currently excited about AI-assisted development and modern full-stack frameworks—
              while staying grounded in proven fundamentals.
